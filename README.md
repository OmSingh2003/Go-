# Learning Go (Golang) üöÄ

This repository documents my journey learning the Go programming language (Golang). It serves as a personal collection of notes, code snippets, solutions to exercises, and small projects I build along the way.

**Current Status:** [E.g., Working through the official Go Tour, Learning about concurrency, Building a simple web server]

## Purpose & Goals ‚ú®

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Solidify my understanding of Go fundamentals (syntax, types, control flow, packages).
* Practice implementing common patterns and features (interfaces, error handling).
* Explore Go's concurrency model (goroutines, channels).
* Get familiar with the Go standard library.
* Build small, practical projects to apply learned concepts.
* Maintain a reference for myself for future review.

## Repository Structure üìÅ

The repository is organized as follows:

* **/basics**: Code examples covering fundamental Go syntax, types, control structures, functions, etc.
* **/data_structures**: Examples related to arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
* **/concurrency**: Code exploring goroutines, channels, mutexes, and other concurrency primitives.
* **/standard_library**: Examples demonstrating usage of various standard library packages (`fmt`, `net/http`, `os`, `io`, `json`, etc.).
* **/exercises**: Solutions to exercises from tutorials, books, or online platforms. (May have sub-folders per source).
* **/projects**: Small standalone projects built using Go.
    * **/projects/hello_world**: Simple "Hello, World!" examples.
    * **/projects/[project_name]**: Other small projects.
* **/notes**: Personal notes, summaries, or "gotchas" discovered during learning.

## How to Use This Repository üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
    cd [Your-Repo-Name]
    ```
2.  **Navigate** to the relevant directory based on the topic or project.
3.  **Run Go code:** Most examples can be run using the standard Go toolchain (ensure you have Go installed: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)).
    ```bash
    # Run a single file
    go run main.go 

    # Or run based on the package in the current directory
    go run .

    # Build an executable
    go build
    ./[executable_name] 
    ```
